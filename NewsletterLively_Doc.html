		Dear Lively members and friends,
We bring to you the updates of the month! This month there are a lot of exciting events and opportunities for our artists and art lovers. Lively is organizing three events this month. On the 7th we are organizing a small exhibition of local artwork in Rotterdam. It will show art from young people who are new to the art scene and are not yet tainted by fame. On the 14th we will be taking over the woods near Maastricht and hike down a path that will be lined by art works inspired by nature. All the art will be made by organic materials. On the 31th we will have a 24 hour livestream with artists all around the world showing art inspired by their culture. We hope that we will be able to meet some of you there! From everybody at Lively, have an inspiring month.

	Hi! I am Matthew and I am looking for someone who can paint a mural in my bedroom. I really like the old renaissance vibe/style and would like to have something like that on my wall. If you can make it happen or know someone who can, send me a message.
